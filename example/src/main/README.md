# FYTCanbusMonitor

This is a library to provide access to internal CANbus values for FYT based Android head units (i.e. uis7862 or SC9853i).
It will not work with MTCB/MTCD based head-units.

More information about this project can be found here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/developing-an-obd2-canbus-data-logger.4454275/

This repository is meant to provide a library to facilitate access to the Canbus related data, and is not meant to be a standalone app.
That said, there is an example app included which will log all available Canbus data to the screen as well as to a logfile in the Docwnloads/
directory.
